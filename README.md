# Universal_SQL_Watcher

A small but very useful application, which allows us to automatically detect changes in our sql database or unordered behavior or to restore previous records. Very useful when designing new databases and testing new applications. Currently, the application only has a PostgreSQL driver. Ability to save user-defined queries. Support multiple threads at once.
